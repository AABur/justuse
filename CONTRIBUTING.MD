Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to justuse :)

Besides tackling [good first issues](https://github.com/amogorkon/justuse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), there is plenty to do - writing unit tests and try to run them on different platforms and network configurations,
write documentation or come up with questions and ideas to keep us on our toes.

For questions and general discussion, you can use [github discussions](https://github.com/amogorkon/justuse/discussions), for documentation [the github wiki](https://github.com/amogorkon/justuse/wiki).

If you want to contribute code, be aware that we (at least I do) run black/brunette to enforce proper code formatting. 
You can use any indentation style (2,3,4 spaces, tabs..) you like on your side, but don't complain if they get mangled to 4-space indentation.

Please make sure that your code is properly commented - always ask yourself "would future self immediately understand why I wrote it like this in a year from now?" if the answer is no, add a comment.
And please try to refrain from code golfing. We all know the temptation, but.. :)

Well, that's it. Welcome aboard!
